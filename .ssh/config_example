# man ssh_config

# Store a key and its passphrase in the agent on first use.
AddKeysToAgent  yes
# Only use configured identities even if the agent has more identities.
IdentitiesOnly yes

# Default identity is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
# Do not set it via top level `IdentityFile` or `Host *` rule.
# Problem example:
#   The default identity is set via `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
#   The default identity is in the agent.
#   The agent will use the default identity for `github-user1` Host,
#     despite `Host github-user1` rule.

Host github-user1
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user1

Host github-user2
